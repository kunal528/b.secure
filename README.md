# B. Secure

## Problems with the current password managers:
Single point of failure: if the server/database goes down, there goes your passwords


Trust issue: can you really trust that these closed-source softwares will not just read your passwords?

## B. Secure solves all the mentioned problems:
The passwords are stored on the decentralized database that is the Polygon blockchain, hence it will not go down easily


The passwords are encrypted by your private key which belongs to only you. You are the only one who can see your saved passwords.
